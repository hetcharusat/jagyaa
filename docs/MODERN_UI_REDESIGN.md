## Files Modified

### New Files
- `gui/modern_theme.py` - Theme configuration and icon mappings
- `gui/library_modern.py` - Redesigned library with Material Design

### Modified Files
- `main.py` - Applies Material theme on app launch
- `gui/modern_main_window.py` - Updated sidebar with icons and modern styling

### Key Components

```python
# Apply theme in main.py
from gui.modern_theme import ModernTheme
ModernTheme.apply_to_app(app, theme='dark_blue.xml')

# Use icons
from gui.modern_theme import ICONS, ModernTheme
icon = ModernTheme.get_icon(ICONS['upload'], color='white')
button.setIcon(icon)
```

## Available Themes

You can easily change the theme in `main.py`:

- `dark_blue.xml` ‚úì (currently active - recommended)
- `dark_amber.xml`
- `dark_cyan.xml`
- `dark_pink.xml`
- `dark_purple.xml`
- `dark_red.xml`
- `dark_teal.xml`
- `light_blue.xml` (light mode)
- `light_pink.xml` (light mode)
- ...and more

## Before vs After

### Before
- Basic Qt widgets with minimal styling
- Emoji icons (üìäüìÅ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüíæ‚öôÔ∏è)
- Simple flat design
- Limited visual hierarchy

### After
- **Material Design** components
- **Font Awesome** professional icons
- **Gradients, shadows, animations**
- **Clear visual hierarchy**
- **Production-ready appearance**

## How to Test

```powershell
# Run the app
C:/Users/hetp2/OneDrive/Desktop/jagyaa/.venv/Scripts/python.exe main.py
```

The app will now look completely different with:
- Dark, modern theme
- Professional icons
- Beautiful file cards
- Smooth interactions

## Next Steps

1. **Dashboard** - Apply same modern styling with stat cards
2. **Upload Panel** - Add drag-drop zone with animations
3. **Drive Manager** - Modern drive cards with progress bars
4. **Settings** - Organized sections with icons

## Dependencies Added

```

These are already installed and working!
