## ‚ùì **Common Questions**

**Q: Will I lose my uploaded files?**  
**A:** No! Files stay on Google Drive. You just need to reconnect.

**Q: Do I need to re-upload everything?**  
**A:** No! As long as you log in with the same Google account, you'll see all your files.

**Q: What if I used a custom OAuth client?**  
**A:** Either fix it in Google Cloud Console OR recreate the drive with rclone's default OAuth (works immediately).

**Q: Can I prevent this from happening?**  
**A:** OAuth tokens expire after ~1-2 months. The app now checks before uploads and alerts you early!
